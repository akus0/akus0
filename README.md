### hi there, i'm matt. but also use the online handle akuso.

i finished my comp sci degree in 2016 but lost interest in programming and have just got back into it recently with a renewed enthusiasm.  

my last few years at work ive been working with ms sql server systems and have gotten pretty familiar with that. but since getting back into real programming in my free time I have been enjoying some lower level c coding but am looking to apply the skills i have refreshed to web development.

i have been using neovim which has made the programming experience a lot more enjoyable and something i look forward. feel free to peek my dotfiles (:
